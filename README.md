# Aim: To study and implement Recursion

## Theory:

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem.
It breaks a complex problem into smaller subproblems of the same type until a base condition is reached.

**Advantages**

- Simpler and shorter code.

- Natural way to solve problems like factorial, Fibonacci, Tower of Hanoi, tree traversal, etc.

**Disadvantages**

- More memory usage (each call stored in function call stack).

- Slower than iteration due to overhead of function calls.

- Risk of stack overflow if base case is missing or wrong.

**Applications of Recursion**

- Mathematical problems (factorial, Fibonacci, power function).

- Divide and conquer algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search).

- Data structures (Trees, Graphs, Linked Lists).

- Backtracking problems (N-Queens, Sudoku, Maze solving).
